# Mines Shell (mish)
Command Line Interface shell that works similarly to the bash terminal, with less functionality.

This program was built in C++ 23 using CMake as an Operating Systems class project.
This program also uses the external library: GNU Readline.

This shell supports piping, parallel commands, and input/output redirection.
There is a command history and tab auto-completion as well as it tells the user the current working directory.
